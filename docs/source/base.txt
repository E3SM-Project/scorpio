\mainpage Software for Caching Output and Reads for Parallel I/O (SCORPIO)

The SCORPIO (Software for Caching Output and Reads for Parallel I/O)
library was developed to improve the ability of component models of 
the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) to perform I/O efficiently
by leveraging other low-level I/O libraries. The SCORPIO library was
derived from the Parallel I/O library (PIO) that
has been developed over several years
to improve the ability of component models of the Community Earth
System Model (CESM) and Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM)
to perform I/O. The interface is
sufficiently general to be useful to a broader spectrum of
applications. The focus of development has been on backend tools that
use the NetCDF file format. SCORPIO currently supports NetCDF, PnetCDF and
ADIOS as the backend libraries.

SCORPIO supports the interfaces supported by the PIO library and includes
C and F90 APIs compatible with the PIO library. The library
also includes improvements in user data caching and aggregation
algorithms that significantly improve performance. A new decomposition strategy
has been introduced which gives the user more ability to tune I/O
communications.

This user's guide provides information on how to use the SCORPIO library and
an overview of the internal algorithms used by the library.

Please review the ChangeLog that is included with the distribution for
up-to-date release information.
