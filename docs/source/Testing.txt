## Building SCORPIO Tests

To build SCORPIO tests, follow the general instructions for building SCORPIO in either the [Installation](@ref install) page or the [Machine Walk-Through](@ref mach_walkthrough) page. The tests can be built using the tests target.
<pre>
> make tests
</pre>


## Running SCORPIO tests
The SCORPIO library includes many unit and functional tests. To run the tests on a Linux desktop use the test target or the CMake test driver, ctest, from the command line.
<pre>
> make test |& tee test.log
</pre>
or
<pre>
> ctest |& tee test.log
</pre>
To run the tests on a machine with a batch job scheduler refer to the appropriate user guide on how to run executables from a batch job. A sample PBS job script is given below for reference
<pre><code>
      #!/bin/bash

      #PBS -q debug
      #PBS -l nodes=1:ppn=4
      #PBS -N piotests
      #PBS -e piotests.e$PBS_JOBID
      #PBS -o piotests.o$PBS_JOBID

      export BUILD_DIR=/scratch/SCORPIO

      cd $BUILD_DIR

      ctest |& tee test.log
</code></pre>
