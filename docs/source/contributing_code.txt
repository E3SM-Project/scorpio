## Backward Compatibility ##
We cannot remove or change a function in the public C or Fortran API.
Please create a github issue if a new API is required.

## Code Formatting ##
Some legacy code in the library may not follow the code format specified below
<ul>
<li> Use spaces instead of tabs. 2 Spaces for each indentation unit (tab)  </li>
<li> Braces start on the same line as the conditional statement  </li>
<li> Do not omit braces for conditionals with a single statement. It is ok to write the block with a single statement in a single line  </li>
<li> Use consts instead of MACROs for constants. Prefer inline functions to MACROs  </li>
<li> Namespace names start with a capital letter and use underscore to combine words, each starting with a capital letter (e.g. namespace My_Namespace{} ) </li>
<li> Class names start with a capital letter and do not contain underscores in the name (e.g. class Myclass; ) </li>
<li> Class member function names are lower case and use underscore to combine words (e.g. void foo_bar(void); ) </li>
<li> Private member variable names are lower case and have an underscore (e.g. int foo_) at the end  </li>
</ul>

## Code development ##
We closely follow the [E3SM project software development guidelines](https://docs.e3sm.org/E3SM/dev-guide/)
<ul>
<li> Bugs and issues are tracked using github issues and changes are reviewed and merged using github pull requests. </li>
<li> User branches that include changes are created on a branch named, GITHUB_USER_NAME/NAME_DESCRIBING_CHANGE . A github pull request is created for merging the development branch to the "master" branch  </li>
<li> The github repository has a "develop" branch where all the changes are merged and after nightly testing the changes are merged to the "master" branch. </li>
<li> Nightly testing of the "develop" and "master" branches is done using Jenkins and the results are available on [CDash](https://my.cdash.org/index.php?project=E3SM_SCORPIO) </li>
</ul>
